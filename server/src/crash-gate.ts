/**
 * Deterministic crash points for durability tests.
 *
 * A test arms a gate for a named step with a marker file and a release file. When the
 * product code reaches `crashPoint(step)` the marker file is written and the call blocks
 * until the release file appears — which the test never creates, so the child process
 * stays exactly at that point until the test parent SIGKILLs it. This lets a crash test
 * kill a real process between two specific durable steps instead of racing the scheduler.
 *
 * Gates are armed per process; production code never arms one, so `crashPoint` is a
 * no-op outside tests.
